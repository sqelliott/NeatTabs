Actions to stop doing:
1. One thing our team should stop doing is being late to the scrum meetings. When we know that we are going to miss a scrum meeting.


Actions to start doing:
1. Our team needs to better develop our unit testing methods. This will involve researching standardized unit testing techniques and apply these to our own software.
2. We need to start better maintaining documentation throughout the scrum process. We need to documentat who is working on tasks, what is expected of that task, the progress this person is making with this task, and so on. This way, we can review our progress throughout and after a sprint to see if we are doing what we are supposed to be doing and getting what needs to be done done.
3. Start integrating.We should begin demoing our work to each other at regular intervals to ensure that progress is being made and we are not veering off course.
4. We need to start creating definitions of done for each task
5. We should start better communicating roadblocks that affecting meeting attendance or deadlines.


Actions to keep doing:
1. One thing our team should keep doing is having additional meetings outside of Scrum meetings to collaborate, discuss, and work on the project together.
2. Another thing to keep doing is discussing the various ways of implementing a function or requirement and hashing out how feasible each option is. This allows for every member to be involved in the thought process and for the pros and cons to be weighed out as a collective.


Work completed/not completed:
This is a list of the user stories that were completed during the previous sprint, and a list of the user stories not completed during this sprint (but which were part of this sprint, and were in the sprint plan).


Stories Uncompleted:
1. (8) As a user, I want to see and visualize the different websites I spend my time on with a user-specified (daily, weekly, etc.) basis
2. (8) As a user, I want to be able to group together certain domains/tabs that have similar uses to me ({Netflix,YouTube} versus {ecommons, my.ucsc.edu}) - Tree View
Stories Completed:
1. (5) As a user, I want to be able to choose what tabs to save or exclude without having to close any of my open tabs.
2. (13) As a user, I want to be able to see previous sessions that are not active anymore.




Work completion rate:
This section should report the following: total number of user stories completed during the prior sprint. Total number of estimated ideal work hours completed during the prior sprint. Total number of days during the prior sprint. For the previous sprint, the user stories/day and ideal         work hours/day figures should be reported. For sprints past the first sprint, this section should also provide the average user stories/day and average ideal work hours/day figures computed across all sprints to date. The final sprint burnup chart for the previous sprint should be available for viewing in the lab and an email of this chart sent to the TA/prof.


Total number of user stories complete for Sprint 1: 2 user stories completed/2 user story incomplete
Total number of estimated ideal work hours completed for Sprint 1: 37 hours
Total Sprint 1 estimated work hours: 19.5 hours
