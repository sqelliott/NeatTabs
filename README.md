# NeatTabs

### Preface

Tab-O-Rama is a team of 4 students currently enrolled in CMPS 115 (Introduction to Software Engineering). This class revolves around learning the ins and outs of Scrum.

### Motivation

We are developing this specifically because we are looking for a solution to cut down on cluttered browser windows. Not only does this allow for better readability across tabs titles, but also for quick and easy searchability. We believe that having an organized workflow that revolves around a single focus is key to productivity.

### Features

* Save and restore all open tabs according to associated windows
* Choose and select which tabs or windows to save
* Quickly restore the previous session at the click of a button
* [TODO] Track and view your time spent on domains
* [TODO] Block distracting domains to focus on productivity

### Installation

Install the NeatTabs Chrome Extension from the Chrome Web Store here!

### Usage

1. Simply install the Chrome Extension from the Google Web Store.
2. NeatTabs should automatically start logging analytics such as domains visited.
3. Click the icon to bring up the options menu where you can save, restore, and view your past sessions.

### Future

This is very much an app developed for a quarter-based class. All in all, we only have around 10 weeks (3 sprints) from start to finish to work on this extension. While the future is uncertain (most likely bleak), we hope that you take this and further develop it on your own time!

It would be nice to port this project to something that is maintainable across multiple browsers such as Safari and Firefox but for the time being, it is unfeasable to do so.
